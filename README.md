# Hi there, I'm Chris 👋

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a **Python Backend Developer** and **AI/ML enthusiast** with a unique journey back to tech. After 14 years as an **IT Specialist in the U.S. Army** (25Q/25B) managing networks, satellite communications, and secure systems in combat environments, I transitioned to civil design. Now, I'm returning to my tech roots, combining my IT infrastructure experience with modern development skills.

**Currently:** Civil Designer by day, Python developer by night  
**Learning:** Backend development, AI/ML, and prompt engineering  
**Location:** Houston, TX 🤘  
**Superpower:** Staying calm under pressure and connecting different ideas

## 🎌 Beyond Code

When I'm not coding or designing:
- 🎬 Watching isekai anime (always looking for recommendations!)
- 🏋️ Hitting the gym
- 🚀 Reading about space exploration (AI/ML + Space = 🤯)
- 💻 Planning my first computer build from scratch
- 📖 Learning something new (it's my hobby!)

## 💪 My Story

From barely doing one push-up in basic training to exceeding Army standards. From IT infrastructure in Iraq to civil design in Houston. From rediscovering my tech passion through YouTube to building a new career. 

I believe in **resilience**, **continuous growth**, and **solving problems that matter**. Every challenge is just a puzzle waiting to be solved.
